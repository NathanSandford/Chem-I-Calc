# Chem-I-Calc: The Chemical Information Calculator

Chem-I-Calc is a python package for evaluating the chemical information content
of resolved star spectroscopy.
It takes advantage of the Fisher information matrix and the Cramér-Rao inequality
to quickly calculate the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs), which give the best
theoretically achievable precision from a set of observations.
