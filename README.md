# Chem-I-Calc: The Chemical Information Calculator

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/199857669.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/199857669)

Chem-I-Calc is an open source python package for evaluating the chemical information content
of resolved star spectroscopy.
It takes advantage of the Fisher information matrix and the Cramér-Rao inequality
to quickly calculate the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs), which give the best
theoretically achievable precision from a set of observations.
