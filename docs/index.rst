Chem-I-Calc: The Chemical Information Calculator
================================================

**Chem-I-Calc** is a python package for evaluating the chemical information content of resolved star spectroscopy. It takes advantage of the Fisher information matrix and the Cramér-Rao inequality to quickly calculate the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs), which give the best theoretically achievable precision from a set of observations.
